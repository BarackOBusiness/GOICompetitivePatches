# GOI Competitive Patches
This plugin exists to organize patches to certain scenes or categories intended to make competition more consistent or fix bugs.\
It is not the goal of this plugin to do so without making any changes to game physics so well established categories like glitchless are off limits
unless the will of the playerbase to make sweeping changes to said competitive scenes does arise.

## Current Patches
- Make all rigidbodies in cavern map use continuous collision detection mode to reduce clipping into terrain and improve consistency of hammer traction
